# Behavioral Feedback

<!-- This file records your corrections and preferences for how the agent should
     behave. The agent reads this at the start of every session.

     You can also tell the agent things like "I wish you would..." or "next time,
     please..." and it will add entries here automatically.

     Long-term, this file can be exported as a specification for improving the
     agent's code and default behaviors. -->
