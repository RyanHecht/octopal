# PARA Vault

This is an Obsidian-compatible vault organized using the [PARA method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/).

## Structure

- **Projects/** — Active efforts with a clear outcome and deadline
- **Areas/** — Ongoing responsibilities with no end date
- **Resources/** — Topics of interest and reference material
- **Archives/** — Completed or inactive items from the above categories
- **Inbox/** — Raw notes and brain dumps awaiting processing
- **Templates/** — Note templates

## Getting Started

1. Open this folder as an Obsidian vault
2. Install the [Obsidian Tasks](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks) plugin for task management
3. Use `octopal ingest "your notes"` to add content via the agent, or create notes manually

## Task Format

Tasks use the Obsidian Tasks emoji format:

```markdown

```

Priority: 🔺 highest, ⏫ high, 🔼 medium, 🔽 low, ⏬ lowest
